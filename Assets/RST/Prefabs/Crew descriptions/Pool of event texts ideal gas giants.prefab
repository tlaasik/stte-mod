  items:
  - This gas giant has a lot of harvestable fuel elements in the atmosphere. Atmospheric
    conditions are ideal for orbital mining.
  - Significant amount of fuel elements detected in the atmosphere of the gas giant.
    Damage risk during harvesting is estimated to be very low.
  - This gas giant seems to be full of fuel elements. General atmospheric conditions
    are ideal for orbital mining.
  - This gas giant contains good quality fuel elements. Atmospheric conditions are
    perfect for orbital mining.
  - This gas giant contains plenty of harvestable fuel elements in its atmosphere.
    General conditions are ideal for orbital mining.
  - Fuel can be harvested relatively safely from this gas giant. No significant risks
    detected.
  - This gas giant has a thick layer of fuel elements in its outer atmosphere. Estimated
    risk of accidents during fuel harvesting operations is low.
  - Harvestable fuel elements found in outer layers of the gas giant's atmosphere.
    Atmospheric conditions stable, all risks low.
  - This gas giant has a large volume of harvestable fuel elements in the atmosphere.
    Atmospheric conditions are safe for orbital mining.
  - This gas giant has a large volume of harvestable fuel elements in the atmosphere.
    General atmospheric conditions are stable and almost perfect for orbital mining.
