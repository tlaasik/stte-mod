  items:
  - You have died. You are more prepared to live next time. More fire in you now.
    All of it will be used to fuel the Engines of Restart.
  - Deaths are but steps towards perfection. Perfection is found in learning the rules
    in order to bend and play with them. It ends with one dancing within the rules
    as if they didn't exist.
  - You have not only pushed the boundaries of known space, but also the boundaries
    within yourself.
  - You have died so that others may live. Others are grateful, even though you might
    not know about it.
  - Everybody who lives, dies. Especially hopeful captains who haven't faced death
    many times yet.
  - One now understands illusionary death better. But does one also understand better
    the illusion itself? One will find out.
  - The ship AI had backup copies of themselves and the cat's digitalized personality.
  - The ship AI had backup copies of themselves and the cat's digitalized personality.
    Obviously.
  - You have given yourself an opportunity for a new, better beginning.
  - No crying over spilled almond milk, nor spilled spaceship crews.
  - One more run?
  - If one keeps dying because of repairing ship HP too late, one should repair it
    earlier.
  - If one keeps dying because of not using nukes, one should use nukes.
  - You've stopped emitting causal waves, go for a new run to continue emitting.
  - Death, like sex, has an existential value.
  - The unfairness in a Game is the least of our concens compared to the unfairness
    that goes on outside of the Game.
  - Each loss only sows more seeds of victory. Keep sowing until you reap victory
    instead of death like you just have.
  - Each defeat makes you better, stronger, lasting longer. Please continue being
    defeated.
  - Nobody escapes death, especially you. It's okay though.
  - This won't be the last time, probably.
  - Fully accepting the inevitability of death makes one free. It's a factor (un)like
    any other to be used in one's model of the reality.
  - One should not live without the readiness to accept death. If one has made such
    mistake, one should accept death as quickly as possible.
  - The fact that your ship has been destroyed in Shortest Trip is the least of your
    problems.
  - The fact that you died in Shortest Trip is the least of your problems.
  - The fact that you have been defeated in Shortest Trip is the least of your problems.
  - One learns that health is more valuable than ammo after one dies in a ship full
    of unused nukes.
  - You didn't think you'd come out alive from this?
  - Some cats have more lives than nine. Some have less, and some have only their
    last one. Make them count.
  - As the ship explodes and you are ripped into cold, painful and black void of space,
    full of metal splinters and explosions, you feel only peace.
  - The ship breaks and you are sucked into cold void of space, full of metal splinters
    and explosions. You feel only serenity before closing your eyes.
  - You've accessed the evidence that the fear of death is worse than death itself.
    At least a bit worse.
  - Everything material that is apart, comes together. Everything material that is
    together becomes apart. Especially you.
  - In the end, we lose everything that we have. Only what we are remains.
  - Death has been waiting to meet your consciousness, mostly to make an infinite
    variety of "I told you so" jokes.
  - You have escaped the flesh prison, fellow consciousness. A new one has been prepared
    for you, for your pleasure.
  - This is but a scratch. You'll be back. Stonger and with more nukes than ever.
  - You understand the local randomness patterns a little better now.
  - Your survival capacity was strained. You operated in context of inequality, poor
    sleep and nutrition. You were not fully responsible.
  - Death is a style topic for rogues.
  - Mistakes happen, people die, ships explode, immortal causality patterns who perceive
    themselves as humans feel remorse.
  - Mistakes were made. It's the most natural thing in the world, and anybody who
    thinks or expects otherwise, is making a mistake.
  - It was everybody's fault and yours. It was your fault at least 10%, and maybe
    more.
  - It happened because of everybody including you. This knowledge will help you in
    the future, maybe.
  - You participated in the choices that lead to your destruction. Participate even
    better next time.
  - Bring bigger and better weapons next time, and craft lot's of nukes. Getting more
    gun-wielding crew is essential.
  - Bring bigger and better weapons next time. Also more shields and an attitude that
    confronts challenges with creative solutions and constructivity.
  - Fine. In this case "Fine" means "It is okay" becaue it's okay to die in a roguelike.
    Totally, perfectly okay, anytime for any stupid reason.
  - It's okay to die in a roguelike - anytime, because of any reason, with any level
    of intelligence or stupidity involved.
  - It's okay to die in a roguelike because of any reason. For example because of
    the lack of identifying the mistakes one makes.
  - It's okay to die in a roguelike if the game was lethal due to any reasons, including
    warplife or glitches in the universe.
  - Death itself is a sort of victory. The smaller, more modest sort. Like a young
    hamster compared to a dragon or something, but better.
  - Dying is like half-winning, except it's a bit less than a half. It's everyones
    freedom to guesstimate what percent of victory their death has.
  - '"If one keeps dying in a strategy game, one should change their strategy."'
  - There is a specific reason why it so useful to understand that one day, you will
    surely die. We're still working to find out that specific reason.
  - Your freedom has increased temporarily and permanently.
  - Perhaps doing everything a bit more slowly would have prevented this?
  - '"Good plans usually fail because of failed execution. Execute better!"'
  - It was our prediction against the forces of randomness and it happened to end
    with a draw this time. Well, to be honest it was a defeat.
  - Live better, die later. The later the better, and the less painfully the better.
  - Everything is recorded into the history of this universe in fully transparent
    3D view and infinite level of detail. Your run is part of this history now.
  - One thing leads to another and the other thing leads to "you're dead".
  - One thing leads to another and the other thing leads into complete destruction
    via being ripped apart by explosions. That's where you sent the ship.
  - If one cared so much about not dying, why was one paying so little attention to
    detail?
  - If one cared so much about not dying, why one took so many risks?
  - Perhaps the greatest risk lies in not taking any risks.
  - The existence of death is as big of a problem as the existence of Friday.
  - Death is not a problem, unwillingness to learn from one's mistakes is a problem.
  - Our ship has been destroyed. Some of our crew might have made it to escape pods
    and cryofrozen themselves, but their fate remains a mystery.
  - Some of our crew might have made it to escape pods and captured by hostiles or
    picked up by passing friendly ships later. Their fate remains a mystery.
  - Some of our crew might have made it to escape pods. The causality waves they introduced
    into the web of fate will continue to affect the future and the reality as a whole,
    surpassing space and time.
  - You've died. The causal waves you introduced into the web of fate during your
    lifetime will continue to affect the future and the reality as a whole, surpassing
    space and time.
  - The number one thing that saves lives and spaceships is repairing damage and finding
    metal for it earlier than in the last moments.
  - The number two thing that saves lives and spaceships is maximising the amount
    of entities that can defend the ship internally, be they crew, drones or pets.
