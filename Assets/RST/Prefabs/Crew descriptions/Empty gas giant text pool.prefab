  items:
  - The gravitational pull of this gas giant is too strong for fuel mining operations.
  - An extremely chaotic atmosphere makes this planet too dangerous for fuel harvesting.
  - Risk of lethal atmospheric conditions is way over threshold, nothing to do here.
  - This gas giant has no quality fuel elements in its atmosphere, nothing to do here.
  - The atmosphere of this gas giant is almost constantly exploding, due to volatility.
    Attempting to harvest from here would be lethal.
  - This gas giant is dotted with numerous mega-cyclones and dangerous atmospheric
    events. We cannot harvest from it.
  - The amount of mega-level destructive atmospheric events in the atmosphere is too
    high to consider fuel harvesting.
  - Our sensors show constant plasma storms ravaging the atmosphere. This gas giant
    is extremely dangerous. We cannot harvest from here.
  - This gas giant is almost covered in plasma reactions - it could become a small
    star one day. And of course, there is nothing for us to find from here except
    death.
  - This gas giant does not have any elements we could process into fuel.
  - All fuel elements are too deep in the atmosphere of this gas giant, we cannot
    harvest from here.
  - Not enough fuel elements in the atmosphere for cost-effective harvesting.
  - Massive megacyclones ravage the atmosphere, nothing to do here.
  - The atmospheric fuel elements are too deep inside the atmosphere for safe access.
  - There's trace amounts of fuel elements in the atmosphere, but not enough to justify
    harvesting.
  - This gas giant does not have the fuel elements we need.
  - The planet's fiery surface regularly creates firestorms which ignite atmospheric
    gases. The planet is too risky for any operations.
  - Corrosive compounds in the atmosphere prevent cost-effective harvesting operations.
  - No suitable fuel compounds found in the atmosphere.
