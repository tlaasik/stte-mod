  items:
  - Any damage to ship module makes it completeley nonfunctional.
  - Damaging enemy shield module cancels all the shield effects it produces.
  - Damaging enemy weapons right before their loading finishes is pretty useful.
  - Neutralize enemy shields with brute laser firepower if hitting their shield module
    is unlikely.
  - Older engines and reactors may sometimes malfunction and cause fires.
  - Crewmembers with above-average moving speed usually make good fire safety officers.
  - Selecting crew is a lot easier if you drag a selection box around the individual
    instead of clicking.
  - Older weapons and missiles tend to use excessive amounts of explosives.
  - You learn that hitpoints are more valuable than ammo after you've died a few times
    because of trying to save a nuke.
  - You learn that hitpoints are more valuable than ammo after you've died a few times
    in a ship armed with nukes.
  - Crew with gunnery skill increases accuracy of ship weapons they operate.
  - Older modules can sometimes malfunction and cause fires.
  - The circle around your ship in star system view is sensor range.
  - The circle around your ship in sector view is long-distance sensor range.
  - You can only see enemy fleets if they have stealth value lower than stealth detection
    of your ship.
  - Utility drones are not visually represented in Mothership internal view. They
    are only used automatically during events.
  - Your ship always carries a set of cheaply printable utility bots (scouting, mining,
    research etc) that are used automatically during events.
  - Losing utility bots during events may result in loss of synthethics and metals.
  - Sometimes losing utility bots doesn't result in resource loss because their components
    were recovered.
  - Your ship uses metals and synthethics to construct utility bots automatically.
  - Crew will add their skill bonus when operating some modules or ship weapons.
  - Material converters allow processing one resource into another. This can make
    the difference between life and death.
  - Your ship automatically builds & tactically sacrifices utility bots during battles
    that happen off-screen. This results in loss of metals & synthethics.
  - Your ship automatically prints cheap missiles, bombs and mines during battles
    that happen off-screen. This results in loss of explosives.
  - Xenodata functions as a form of intergalactic digital currency. It is generated
    while researching alien planets, for example.
  - Xenodata documented by researching sentient aliens is worth many data credits.
  - Xenodata documented by researching warplife is worth many data credits.
  - Xenodata documented by researching anomalies is worth many data credits.
  - Xenodata documented by researching alien nature is usually worth some data credits.
  - Life support modules contain biological nanobots that process or recycle all suitable
    organics into various substances required by crew. Mostly food & drugs.
  - Desperate captains can scrap reactors, nukes or other modules as an emergency
    source of fuel.
  - Check out the help screen (button in lower right screen) for useful details about
    game mechanics.
  - Check out the help screen (button in lower right screen) for useful details about
    game mechanics.
  - Almost all game elements have hover texts with useful info.
  - Almost all game elements have hover texts with valuable info.
  - Almost all game elements have hover texts with practical information.
  - You can change the game UI color in game options - try it!
  - Check out the "?" button in lower right corner to see a list of illustrated help
    topics.
  - Eco-harvesting operations usually do not collect more organics than your ship
    can carry.
  - When you get excess organics or synthethics and have a fuel convertor, convert
    these resources into fuel instead of dumping them.
  - Selecting crew is a lot easier if you drag a selection box around the crew instead
    of clicking.
  - Selecting crew is a lot easier if you drag a selection box around the crew instead
    of clicking.
  - You can reposition module info window at any time by holding & dragging it on
    the game screen.
  - If the game is too hard, change your tactics.
  - If the game is too difficult, change your approach.
  - Targeting key enemy modules during battle can make the difference between life
    and death.
  - If you keep dying, then consider escaping battles with negative outlook earlier.
